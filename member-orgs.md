### [I AM THAT GIRL (IATG)](https://www.facebook.com/pg/IATGUSC/about/?ref=page_internal)

A girl’s physical, emotional and mental well-being is rooted in her self-worth. And we are living in an epidemic of self-doubt. I AM THAT GIRL is helping girls to transform self-doubt in to self-love by providing a safe space to be lifted up and have honest conversations about things that matter. Every day, girls are bombarded with messages that attack what she is NOT and we work every day to help her love who SHE IS; to see that in herself and inspire that in others.
