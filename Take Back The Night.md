### Take Back the Night & Clothesline Project

“‘Survive. Speak. Thrive.’ Take Back the Night is a week of events dedicated to promoting awareness 
of and protesting against sexual violence. The purpose of Take Back the Night is to empower studetns 
to feel safe in their communities, while highlighting the need for institutional change in transforming a rape culture, 
rather than resorting to reactionary, victim-blaming policies.”
