### Fem Fest

Hosted by the Womenâ€™s Student Assembly, FemFest is an annual feminist music festival to fight 
back against the pesky patriarchal music industry. FemFest is about creating safe(r), 
welcoming and comfortable spaces for everyone. This festival provides an alternative to the sexist hetero/cisnormative
campus culture, introduces students to radical politics and to our space, and encourages artists to take space within our 
community and embrace a more intersectional feminist identity at USC.
