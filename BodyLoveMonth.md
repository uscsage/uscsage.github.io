### Body Love Month

The Body Love Initiative is SAGEâ€™s ongoing, yearlong campaign to promote positive body image.  This will include small to large public actions to promote positive body image and open discussions about the health concerns that many people face as a result of oppressive gender norms and limited, socially constructed images of beauty. As a part of the Body Love Initiative, SAGE holds a series of events in October to raise awareness about body positivity, body diversity, and other discussions including, but not limited to, healthy body image, weight stigma, ableism, disordered eating, and healthy sexuality.
