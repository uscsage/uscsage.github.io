### Body Love Month

The Body Love Initiative is WSAâ€™s ongoing, yearlong Campaign to promote positive body image.  This will include small to large public actions to promote positive body image and open discussions about the health concerns that many women and men face as a result of oppressive gender norms and limited, socially constructed images of beauty.
As a part of the Body Love Initiative, WSA holds a month of events to raise awareness about body positivity, body diversity, and other discussions including, but not limited to, healthy body image, weight stigma, ableism, and healthy sexuality.
